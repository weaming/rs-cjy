# rs-cjy

Convert between CSV, JSON, YAML.

After installation, you will get two executable binaries named `csv-json` and `yaml-json`.

They all accept from STDIN, print to STDOUT, and will try to dentect the input type then print as another type.

## TODO

* [ ] keep order of headers
* [ ] parse for different field types
